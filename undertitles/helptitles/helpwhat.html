            I made this website for people to write articles about what is hapening in the world. <br>
            But unlike every news site there is, i didn't want any fake news or biased news. <br>
            so whenever you submit an article instead of going directly public, it will be reviewd by a moderation team. <br>
            And if you ever see a news that is suspicious or fake or biased, you can report it to the moderation team to get it checked.
            <br>
            <br>
            Our site was desinged to:

            2. To keep only the positive news and avoid negative news that talk mainly about politics and religion exct...
            <br>
            3. To help people know the truth about what is hapening in the world.
